# DeepSea

*DeepSea* is a Fabric mod that adds configurable boat behavior in ocean biomes. All loaded boats are periodically checked every 100 ticks (5 seconds ) by default, and those in the configured ocean biomes (`#deepsea:ocean`) and tagged with `#deepsea:boat` will be broken and dropped.

## Compatibility

- **Required:** [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
- **Made to Work With:**
  - [Small Ships](https://modrinth.com/mod/small-ships)
  - [Shippy Ships](https://modrinth.com/mod/shippy-ships)

> By default, only `#c:boats` is included in the `#deepsea:boat` tag and `#c:is_ocean` in the `#deepsea:ocean`.

## Installation

1. Drop the DeepSea `.jar` into your `mods` folder.
2. Start the server or load into a world — the mod is active immediately.

> This is a **server-side only** mod. Clients do **not** need to install it.

## Customization

To include/remove boats just create a datapack for the tag file:

**`data/deepsea/tags/entity_type/boat.json`**

```json
{
  "values": [
    "#c:boats"
  ]
}
```

To include/remove biomes just create a datapack for the tag file:

**`data/deepsea/tags/worldgen/biome/ocean.json`**

```json
{
  "values": [
    {
      "id": "#c:is_ocean",
      "required": false
    }
  ]
}
```
